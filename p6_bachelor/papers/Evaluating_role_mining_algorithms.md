# [Evaluating role mining algorithms](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1542207.1542224?casa_token=EG6dKu95ejEAAAAA:qSXywC5mASXYREZkQ2pnLjPcqFtjGWZZwuLrUNKuA4reTfgcwZn8jo9zYm1UimJ2kC6xYS3frravnA)
While many role mining algorithms have been proposed in recent years, there lacks a comprehensive study to compare these algorithms. These role mining algorithms have been evaluated when they were proposed, buth the evaluations were using different datasets and evaluation criteria.

In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive framework for evaluating role mining algorithms. We categorize role mining algorithms into two classes based on their outputs;
1. Class 1 algorithms output a sequence of prioritized roles while
2. Class 2 algorithms output complete RBAC states. We then develop techniques that enable us to compare these algorithms directly. We also introduce a new role mining algorithm and two new ways for algorithmically generating datasets for evaluation. Using synthetic as well as real datasets, we compared nine role mining algorithms.
