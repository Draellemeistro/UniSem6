### RBAC and role mining
ole-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security policy frame-
work for controlling user access to resources based on roles \[4, 14\]. It is extremely important
for reducing the cost of policy administration, especially in large organizations. An ANSI
standard was created for RBAC \[5, 1\].
Role mining is the problem of analyzing given user-permission relation, to determine a
set of roles with user-role relation and permission-role relation, such that the RBAC policy
grants the same permissions as given \[3\]

### RBAC challenge with role mining.
An RBAC programming challenge was created for LPOP 2018.
