# [Role mining - revealing business roles for security administration using data mining technology](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/775412.775435?casa_token=OdQ6Gt6lGDUAAAAA:Vcfz3JmhVs4hJQG4SDM-b1LbqaLlta0cy0qJgnVgH4KvTJmQ_-qKzLFSYDL_fyvnKexttoCXhBfJUA)

Our results stem from industrial projects, where large-scale customers wanted to migrate to Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) based on already existing access rights patterns in their production IT-systems.
