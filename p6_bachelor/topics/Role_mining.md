### paper 1
[Role mining - revealing business roles for security administration using data mining technology](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/775412.775435)
We desvribe the work devising a new technique for role-finding to implement Role-Based Security Administration. Our results stem from industrial projects, where large-scale customers wanted to migrate to RBAC based on already existing access rights patterns in their production IT-systems.

### Paper 2
[A Scalable Role Minin Approach for Large Organizations](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350795457_A_Scalable_Role_Mining_Approach_for_Large_Organizations)
Role-based access control model has gained significant attention in cybersecurity in recent years. RBAC restrics system access only to authorized users based on the roles and regulations within an organization. The flexibility and usability of this model have encouraged organizations to migrate from traditional Discretionary access control (DAC) models to RBAC. However, this transition requires accomplishing a very challengin task called role mining in which users' roles are generated from existing access control lists.

### Paper 3
[Taming Role Mining complexity in RBAC](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167404810000027)
We address the problem of reducing the role mining complexity in RBAC systems. We propose a three steps methodology:
1. Associate a weight to roles.
2. Identify user-permission assignments that cannot belong to roles with a weight exceeding a given threshold.
3. we restrict the role-finding problem to user-permission assignments identified in the second step.
