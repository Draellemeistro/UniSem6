\subsection{IAM: Identity Access Management}
%Hvad er det, Forskillige termet PAM, IGA osv 
The main goal of Identity Access Management, or IAM, is to provide a framework for managing roles and access to different services for groups of users\cite{Gartner-DefIAM}. It builds on the idea that users should only have access to the tools and assets that they need, while restricting access to superfluous services, so as to combat abuse of privileges.

Originally Identity and Access management was primarily focused on physical security, such as restricting access to facilities with the use of ID badges. With tendencies moving towards many services, assets etc. being remotely accessible by employees, the traditional ways of structuring and managing access-privileges slowly evolved and moved into the realm of cybersecurity\cite{StrongDM-IAM}. 

Hybrid work has become an increasingly common method of work, recently illustrated by the work-from-home movement, which grew to prominence in the fallout of the CoVID epidemic. As such, systems and tools for controlling privileges grew in complexity. Identity Access Management is one of those concepts.%Skal lige finde kilde og / eller omskrive.

IAM frameworks consists of a set of tools to administer identities and access privileges, as well as policies and guidelines on how to monitor and control them over time. %.........

\subsection{Compliance}
 The definition of compliance is the action or fact of complying with a wish or command. This could be a company that complies with applicable rules and laws \citep{2024compliance?}. Compliance can have to definitions, since it can be something that a company is doing and something a company can become \citep{legaldeskcompliance}. A company becomes compliant when it meets the requirements of the different laws, and it does this by setting clear guidelines on how compliance can be reached \citep{legaldeskcompliance}. Compliance is not set when a company reaches compliance, often new legal requirements are published, that companies have to meet the requirements of. 

 \subsection{What are legal requirements?}
Depending on the size of a company, and business area, different guidelines and legal requirements are relevant \cite{2024compliance?}.
