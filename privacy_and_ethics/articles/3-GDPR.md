- [What is GDPR: UK, EU legislation compliance summary fines](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-is-gdpr-uk-eu-legislation-compliance-summary-fines-2018)

# Article
Implemented in around 2018. Replaced previous data protection rules across Europe.
Long time Coming, The old rules were penned in 1990's (at the oldest). A whole lot of things have evolved since then. ya know, the fooking internet.

Made to "harmonize" data privacy laws across Europe. whatever that means.
Dictates how businesses can handle the information, and how they can interacty with it.
(It's a judicial tool to bonk companies on the head if they don't comply)

> it has led to many people in the data protection world, including UK information commissioner Elizabeth Denham, to liken GDPR to an evolution, rather than a complete overhaul of rights

- **Small change for companies that already adhered to the previous rules**

#### What is GDPR exactly?
- The worlds strongest set of data protection rules.
- The full text is an unwieldy beast, 99 individual articles and 173 recitals.
- Exists as a framework for laws across the continent.
- its final form came about after 4 years of discussion and negotiating.
- Adopted by EU Parliament and EU Council in April 2016.
- Came into force on May 25, 2018.
- Lauded as pretty good (a progressive approach to how peeps personal data should be handled)

#### Who does GDPR apply to?
> [!note] At the heart of GDPR is personal data
> Broadly this is information that allows a living person to be directly, or indirectly, identified from data that's available.

- Under GDPR theres also a few special categories of sensitive personal data that are given greater protections. Includes:
  - Racial or ethnic origin
  - Political opinions
  - Religious or philosophical beliefs
  - Trade union membership
  - genetic data or biometric data
  - health data
  - sex life or sexual orientation

The crucial thing about what constitutes personal data is that it allows a person to be identified
**THUS** even if the data has been pseudonymized, the GDPR still applies to it if the person can be identified from it.


##### Something about Controllers and Processors...?
Oh, yeah... of course its described right after being mentioned.
###### Controllers
- The Main decision makers. They exercise control over the personal data.
- Also possible to have joint controllers, where two or more organizations jointly determine the purposes and means of processing personal data.
- **CONTROLLERS HAVE STRICTER OBLIGATIONS UDNER GDPR THAN PROCESSORS**
###### Processors
- Processors act on behalf, and only on the instructions of, the relevant controller.

#### What are GDPR's key principles?
there are seven ah dem bitches.
- laid out in article 5 of the GDPR.
which have been designed to guide how people's data can be handled. They don't act as hard rules, but instead as an overarching framework that is designed to layout the broad purposes of GDPR.

##### Seven key principles
- Lawfulness
- fairness
- transparency
- purpose limitation
- data minimization
- accuracy
- storage limitation
- integrity and confidentiality (security)
- accountability

In reality only **accountability** is a new principle, the others have been around for a while. (Ex: in the UK's Data Protection Act 1998, all the others were present)

###### Data minimization
Important (aren't they all?) because it requires organizations to only collect data that is strictly necessary for the purpose they have stated. This means that if a company wants to collect data for one purpose, it can't then use that data for another purpose without going back to the person and asking for their consent.
"_You should identify the minimum amount of personal data you need to fulfil your purpose,_" the ICO says. "_You should hold that much information, but no more._"

##### Integrity and confidentiality (security)
after the old data protection laws were written, (20 years before GDPR, give or take) businesses and orgs discovered/developed a bunch of best practices for protecting data/info.
**GDPR makes these practices a legal requirement.** Now dis shit official
- Personal data must be protected against "_Unauthorised or unlawful processing_" as well as accidental loss, destruction or damage.
  - (If it leaks, its yo fault for storing it business-boyy)
- GDPR doesn't dictate exactly what good security practices look like (differs from org to org, system to system)
  - A bank needs different protection, compared to dentist
- **ALTHOUGH... broadly, proper access controls to information should be put in place, websites should be encrypted, and pseudonymisation is encouraged.**
> "_Your cybersecurity measures need to be appropriate to the size and use of your network and information systems_"

##### accountability
New kid on the block, baby. With those big ol' judicial systems looking to let the fines blast away (pew pew), it only makes sense to give orgs some way of proving they are working to comply and uphold GDPR. At its simplest:
- Documenting how personal data is handled, and the steps taken to ensure only people who need to acces some information are the ones who can.
- Can also include training staff in data protection measures and regularly evaluating and data handling procedures.

- The whole "_Destruction, loss, yada yada..._" has to be reported to a country's data protection regulator. (the country where it could have a detrimental impact on the disclosed individuals)
- **INCLUDES:** (but not limited to)
  - Financial loss
  - confidentiality breach
  - damage to reputation
  - etc. (discrimination, identity theft, fraud, financial loss, etc.)
- (in the UK, this is the Information Commissioner's Office has to be informed of data breaches within 72 hours of the organization becoming aware of it)
  - Companies also have to inform the people affected by the breach.
  - If the breach is serious enough, the company has to inform the public

- For companies 250+ employees, also need docs on why info is being collected and processed, descriptions of the info, how long it's being kept, and descriptions of technical security measures in place.
- **GDPR Article 30** lays ot that most orgs need to keep records of their data processing, how data is shared and also how it is stored.

- Additionally, orgs taht have "_regular and systematic monitoring_" of individuals at a large scale or who process a lot of sensitive personal data have to employ a data protection officer (DPO). (**this is a legal requirement**)

#### What are my GDPR rights?
> hile GDPR arguably places he biggest tolls on data controllers and processors, the legislation is designed to help protect the rights of individuals.

- Right to be informed
- Right of access
- Right to rectification
- Right to erasure
- Right to restrict processing
- Right to data portability
- Right to object
- plus rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling.

##### Access to your data
##### Automated processing, erasure and data portability

#### GDPR breaches and fines
- them bitches are **BIIIG**
