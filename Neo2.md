### **1. Differences Between Typical IoT and Standard Wireless Devices**

Typical IoT devices differ from standard wireless devices in the following ways:

- **Power Consumption:** IoT devices are optimized for low power consumption, while standard wireless devices (e.g., smartphones) prioritize performance.
- **Connectivity:** IoT devices often use LPWAN (e.g., LoRa, NB-IoT) or short-range protocols (e.g., Zigbee, Bluetooth), while standard wireless devices rely on high-speed Wi-Fi or cellular networks.
- **Processing Power:** IoT devices have limited computational capabilities as they are designed to perform specific tasks with minimal energy.
- **Communication Patterns:** IoT devices often operate intermittently, sending small amounts of data periodically, unlike standard wireless devices that support continuous data streaming.

### **2. Basic Tasks of an IoT Device & Relative Power Consumption**

A typical IoT device performs the following tasks:

1. **Sensing:** Collects data from the environment using sensors (Low Power)
2. **Processing:** Performs local computation or preprocessing (Medium Power)
3. **Communication:** Transmits data to the cloud or other devices (High Power)
4. **Actuation:** Takes action based on received data (Medium to High Power)

---

### **8. Reservation (Grant-Based) vs. Grant-Free Access**

- **Reservation (Grant-Based) Access:** The device must request access from the network before transmitting data (e.g., LTE, 5G scheduling).
- **Grant-Free Access:** Devices can transmit data without prior request (e.g., LoRa, ALOHA-based systems).
