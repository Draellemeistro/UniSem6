## Data Cleaning
### Missing value imputation techniques
e.g., mean, [[k-nearest neighbor (KNN)]] and regression-based (*[[logistic regression]]*) methods, etc.
### Outlier detection techniques
e.g. GESD, interquartile range rule, [[K-means Clustering]] and [[DBSCAN]] methods etc

---
## Data Reduction
### Row-wise data sample reduction techniques:
random and stratified [[Dimension reduction|sampling]], etc
### Column-wise data variable reduction techniques:
Domain expertise, [[Dimension reduction|feature extraction]] techniques, [[Dimension reduction|feature selection]] techniques

---
