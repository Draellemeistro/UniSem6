> [!NOTE] Support Vector Machines **(SVM)**

- Using the perceptron algorithm, we minimized **Misclassification Errors** 
- in SVMs, our optimization objective is to **maximize the margin**


> [!NOTE] The **margin**
> **Defined as:**
> The distance between the separating hyperplane (**decision boundary**) and the training samples that are the closest to this hyperplane, which are the so called support vectors
>
>- **A larger margin typically results in better generalization to new, unseen data**
>
>This is because it creates a decision boundary that is more robust to slight variations in data points, reducing the chance of overfitting to noise or outliers
