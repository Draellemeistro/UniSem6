Aggregate the prediction by each tree to assign the class label by **majority vote**. Bootstrapping the data plus using the aggregate to make a decision is called **Bagging**

Markov Decision Processes: Finite & Infinite Horizon 
The parameter (funny y) < 1 is called the -discount factor-
- small (funny y) = myopic
- large (funny y) = farsighted
