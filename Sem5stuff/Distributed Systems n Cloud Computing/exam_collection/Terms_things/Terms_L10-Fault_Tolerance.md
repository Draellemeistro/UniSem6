### 1. What is fault tolerance in a distributed system? What is a failure?

### 2. Why do distributed systems often face partial failures?

### 3. What is the purpose of replicating processes or data in distributed systems?

### 4. How do availability and reliability differ as dependability requirements?

### 5. What role do failure detectors play?

### 6. How can fault tolerance improve as the number of components grows?

### 7. What is the main idea behind consensus in faulty systems?

### 8. Why is masking failures important? How does redundancy help with failure masking?

### 9. Why are arbitrary (Byzantine) failures more challenging than crash failures?

### 10. What is the CAP theoremâ€™s significance in fault-tolerant systems?

### 11. What does a two-phase commit protocol achieve?

### 12. What is the general benefit of using hierarchical or flat process groups for replication?

### 13. What is the distinction between a fault, an error, and a failure, and how does each relate to the others?

### 14. Why do we need different replication strategies to handle crash failures versus arbitrary (Byzantine) failures?

### 15. How does the flooding-based consensus algorithm work in the presence of crash failures, and what are its limitations?

### 16. What makes consensus with arbitrary (Byzantine) failures more complex, and how does increasing the number of replicas help?

### 17. In what ways can time redundancy and information redundancy complement physical redundancy to mask failures?

### 18. What steps do consensus protocols take to ensure all nonfaulty nodes process commands in the same order?

### 19. How do fail-stop, fail-silent, fail-safe, and fail-arbitrary models differ in terms of detectability and the complexity of fault-tolerant protocols?

### 20. What role do heartbeat messages play in practical failure detection, and how does adjusting timeouts improve accuracy?
