> [[Architectural Styles]]

### 1. What is the difference between a distributed system and a decentralized system? Why is it important to distinguish between them?
[[System Topologies]]
### 2. What is the essence of a [[Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)]]?
Different components provides services to one another. (think microservices)
### 3. How does publish-subscribe architecture differ from request-reply models?

### 4. Why are [[Peer-to-Peer (P2P)]] architectures considered symmetric?
Processes are all equal y'know. Have equal roles and communicate over an overlay network
### 5. What is the purpose of structured peer-to-peer networks?

### 6. How do [[Distributed Pervasive Systems|pervasive]] systems differ from traditional distributed systems?
The evolution of tech has lead to many new and (often) small computers (ie phones smatwatches, fridge etc). They naturally blend into the environment
### 7. What is a [[Blockchain Architecture]] in broad terms?
unforgeable append-only chain of blocks. Each block is immutable (something about massive and wide replication, y'know the chain is carried by err'one.... WAIT!) Since it is so massively replicated, you would need a tremendous amount of co-conspirators to force changes, thanks to [[Consensus]].
there is the issue of consensus regarding who gets to append to the chain. a leader is counter to the philosophy of blockchain, so most often a variation of [[Election by proof-of-stake]] or [[Elections by proof of work]]
### 8. Why must designers consider incorrect assumptions about networks when building distributed systems?

### 9. Why is it often easier to manage and maintain centralized systems compared to distributed ones?
Well, for one... you don't have to worry about [[Leader Election]], and the general idea is easier to implement and modify, although it carries risks (single point of failure...)
### 10. What distinguishes cluster computing from grid computing in high-performance distributed computing?

### 11. How do layered architectures help in organizing distributed systems?

### 12. In what way is a RESTful architecture an example of a service-oriented approach?

### 13. What is the main difference between structured and unstructured P2P search strategies?

### 14. Why might a super-peer network structure be chosen over a pure P2P architecture?

### 15. How does the complexity of pervasive systemsâ€™ context awareness impact their architectural design?
