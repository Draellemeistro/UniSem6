> [!NOTE] Microservices, benefits, challenges, and scaling
> Microservices architecture, [[Serverless computing]]. Benefits, challenges, and use cases of microservices in distributed systems. Container-based deployment and scaling of microservices


### 1. What is a monolithic architecture? What advantages do monolithic systems offer?
All is collected in one place.
#COMEBACK 
### 2. How do microservices differ from traditional monolithic architectures?
An application is split up into several different microservices, shifting some of the complexity from code to networking. Also #COMEBACK 
### 3. How do containers support microservices?
A microservice is specialized, usually only focused on a tight set of capabilities. Containers fit their needs, and slot nicely into ways of scaling through spinning up more containers rather than changing the code. (therefore utilizing networking)
### 4. What is meant by "[[Auto-scaling]]" in the context of microservices?
Depending on demand, more containers are spun up to handle it, or terminated when unneeded.
### 5. How do microservices handle code complexity versus operational complexity compared to monolithic architectures?
shifting some of the complexity from code to networking
### 6. In what ways does adopting a microservices architecture affect data management strategies?
#COMEBACK 
### 7. Why is designing for failure essential in a microservices environment?
#COMEBACK 
### 8. How do frequent changes to certain parts of an application influence its decomposition into microservices?
#COMEBACK 
### 9. What are some operational tools and practices that become vital when moving to microservices?
#COMEBACK 
### 10. How can load balancers and auto-scalers together improve system efficiency in a microservices setup?
