2. Define [[Lamports logical clocks]].
3. What is the bully algorithm used for?
### Medium
1. How do [[vector clocks]] improve event ordering in distributed systems?
2. Compare centralized and distributed mutual exclusion algorithms.
3. Why is [[leader election]] necessary in distributed systems?
### Hard
