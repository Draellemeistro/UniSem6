### Easy
1. What is fault tolerance?
2. Define Byzantine failures.
3. What is a distributed commit protocol?
### Medium
1. Compare crash failures and Byzantine failures in distributed systems.
2. Explain the concept of failure masking through redundancy.
3. How do process groups ensure resilience in distributed systems?
### Hard
1. Design a consensus algorithm resilient to arbitrary failures.
2. Discuss the challenges of implementing failure detection in large-scale distributed systems.
3. Evaluate the limitations of distributed commit protocols under network partitioning.
