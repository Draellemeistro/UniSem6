### Easy
1. What triggers can invoke an AWS Lambda function?
2. Define event-driven architectures.
3. What does “stateless” mean in serverless functions?
### Medium
1. How does AWS Lambda achieve automatic scaling?
2. Discuss the importance of monitoring and logging in serverless architectures.
3. Explain the concept of function cold starts in [[serverless computing]].
### Hard
1. Compare the efficiency of stateless serverless architectures with traditional stateful architectures.
2. Evaluate the limitations of [[serverless computing]] for high-performance applications.
3. Design a serverless workflow for processing real-time data streams.
