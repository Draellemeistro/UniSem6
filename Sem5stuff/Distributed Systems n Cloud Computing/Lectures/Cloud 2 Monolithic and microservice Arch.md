Each service: runs its own [[process]], can be written in any programming language  and is platform agnostic, independently deployable and replaceable, May use different storage technologies ,requires a minimum of centralized management. Large companies, such as Amazon, eBay, and Netflix, have already adopted microservice architecture as their main architecture.

### Advantages over [[Monolithic Architecture]]
Greater efficiencies as they are typically paired with --auto-scalers-- and --load balancers--. Easily scalable in three ways: Decomposition into simple functions (microservices), Cloning microservices on demand, Partitioning data across a cluster. Services can be cloned or decommissioned based on user requests in real-time.
