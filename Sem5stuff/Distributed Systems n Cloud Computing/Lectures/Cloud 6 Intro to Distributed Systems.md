## All L6 Terms
- Distributed Systems
- [[System Topologies]]
	- **Client-Server Architecture**
		- Traditional, centralized model; different components can be physically distributed across machines but maintain a client-server relationship. Clients send requests, Servers process them and return results.
	- **[[Peer-to-Peer (P2P)]] Architecture** (Structured & Unstructured)
		- Processess(peers) have equal roles and communicate within an overlay network. Can be Structured or Unstructured.
	- **[[Hybrid Architectures]]:** Cloud Computing, Edge Computing, Blockchain Architecture
- 
- [[Architectural Styles]]
	- [[Layered Architectures]]
	- [[Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)]]
	- [[Event-Driven Architecture]] (Publish-Subscribe)
	- [[RESTful Architectures]]
## Tools
- Python (Client-Server Implementation)
## Questions and Thoughts
- What advantages do [[Hybrid Architectures]] provide?
- How do publish-subscribe systems handle scalability?
## Relevant Terms from Other Lectures
- [[Load balancing]] (L2: **[[Terms_L2-Monolithic_Microservice_Archs|Overview L2]]** ----- [[Cloud 2 Monolithic and microservice Arch]])
