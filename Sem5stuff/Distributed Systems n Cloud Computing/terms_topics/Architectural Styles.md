> [!NOTE] **Definition:** Architectural Style
> A style is formulated in terms of: (replaceable) components with well-defined interfaces, the way that components are connected to each other, the data exchanged between components, how these components and connectors are jointly configured into a system.

**[[Layered Architectures]]**  Components are organized in hierarchical layers
**[[Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)]]** Components provide services to one another
**[[Event-Driven Architecture]] (Publish-Subscribe)** Components respond to and manage events, emphasizing asynchronous [[Distributed-Communication]].

(((((([[RESTful Architectures]]))))))
[[Publish-Subscribe Architectures]]???????????
## The Connector
A mechanism that mediates [[Distributed-Communication]], coordination, or cooperation among components. Ex: facilities for (remote) procedure call, messaging, or streaming.
