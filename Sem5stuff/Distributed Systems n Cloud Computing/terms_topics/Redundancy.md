# Redundancy for [[Failure Masking]]
## Types of redundancy
### [[Information-redundancy]]
Add extra bits to data units so that errors can be recovered when bits are garbled
### [[Time-redundancy]]
Design a system such that an action can be performed again if anything went wrong. Typically used when faults are transient or intermittent.
### [[Physical-redundancy]]
Add Equipment or processes in order to allow one or more components to fail. **This type is extensively used in [[Distributed Systems]]** (see [[Replication]])
