From [[Cloud 2 Monolithic and microservice Arch|Lecture 2]] ([[Terms_L2-Monolithic_Microservice_Archs|L2 Overview]])

# Main gist
A [[Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)|SOA]] variation. Approach to developing a single application as a suite of smaller services. Each service:
- Runs its own processes 
- Can be written in any programming language and is platform agnostic 
- Is independently deployable and replaceable 
- May use different storage technologies 
- Requires a minimum of centralized management

## Main advantages
- Greater efficiencies as they are typically paired with auto-scalers and load balancers.
	- **[[Auto-scaling]]:** A cloud computing service feature that automatically adds or removes computing resources based on actual demand. 
	- **[[Load balancing]]:** The process of distributing workload evenly across computing resources in a cloud computing environment 
- Easily scalable in three ways:
	- By decomposition into simple functions 
	- By cloning microservices on demand 
	- By partitioning data across a cluster 
- Services can be cloned or decommissioned based on user requests in real time
### Tradeoffs of microservices
Shifting to microservices architecture means 
- Reducing code complexity while increasing operational complexity 
- Distributing data across multiple processes while ensuring data consistency across processes 
- Simplifying individual services while raising the complexity of coordinating many services.
## Microservices and Container-Based Architectures
- Container Deployment
- Decentralized Governance
- Decentralized Data Management
- Service Meshes
## Questions and Thoughts
- What makes microservices scalable compared to monolithic architectures?
- What are some pitfalls in [[decomposing applications into services]]?
# Look at Microservices


IT teams shift from actively managing hardware and software to managing service layers in the microservice environment

## Properties / Features
- Platform Agnostic (can use different languages in services)
- independent deployment and replaceable (**This is big**)
- Modeled around business domain rather than technical features
## Cons
- **its strength can also be a vulnerability**
	- Can have lots of overhead because its now also about networking.
	- Perspective, weighing needs
- Remove complex from source code onto architecture
	- From understanding code to managing architecture
### Microservice Premium
Microservices impose a cost on productivity that can only be made up for in more complex systems. host the control plane services that implement the intelligence of Kubernetes. They can be physical servers, [[Virtual Machines]], cloud instances, and more. Production clusters usually run three or five control plane nodes for high availability
