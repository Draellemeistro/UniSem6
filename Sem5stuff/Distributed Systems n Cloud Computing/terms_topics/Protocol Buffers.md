**WHY?** 
- Data get serialized very efficiently - Google claims 20 times more efficient than alternatives. **efficient bin encoding format** better than JSON
- **language agnostic... bcuz [[Protocol Buffers]], proto file does stuff**
- Strongly typed

- Language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanism for serializing structured data.
- Protocol buffers are a combination of the definition language (created in .proto files), the code that the proto compiler generates to interface with data, language-specific runtime libraries, and the serialization format for data that is written to a file (or sent across a network connection)
