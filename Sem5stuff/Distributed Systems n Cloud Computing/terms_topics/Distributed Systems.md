#### WHY?
Perfomance improvements such as reliability, scalability, and efficiency. Sometimes its even necessary(e.g., mobile or organizationally seperated systems). HOWEVER! Most centralized systems are still much easier to manage and maintain, so one should think twice before deciding to spread processes and resources.
## Two views on Realizing [[Distributed Systems]]
- **[[integrated view]]:** Connecting existing networked computer systems into a larger system.
- **[[Expansive view]]:** An existing networked computer system is extend with additional computers
### Two definitions
> [!NOTE] **1:** A decentralized system is a networked computer system in which processes and resources are necessarily spread across multiple computers.

> [!NOTE] **2:** A distributed system is a networked computer system in which processes and resources are sufficiently spread across multiple computers.

### [[Cluster Computing]]
- Essentially a group of high-end systems connected through LAN
	- **Homogenous:** same OS, near identical hardware
	- Single or tightly coupled managing node(s)
### [[Grid Computing]]
- **The next step:** plenty of nodes from everywhere
	- **heterogenous**
	- Dispersed across several organizations
	- Can easily span a wide-area network
### [[Distributed Pervasive Systems]]
##### Observation
Emerging next-gen of distributed systems in which nodes are small,mobile and often embedded in a larger system, characterized by the fact that the system naturally blends into the users environment
#### Three overlapping subtypes
###### [[Ubiquitous computing systems]]:
pervasive and continuously present, i.e, there is a continuous interaction between system and user
##### [[Mobile computing systems]]:
pervasive but emphasis is on the fact that devices are inherently mobileÂ 
##### [[Sensor (and actuator) networks]]:
pervasive, with emphasis on the actual (collaborative) sensing and actuation of the environment
