> [!NOTE] [[OS-Level-Virtualization]] ([[Containers]])
> - It is a quite new way of [[Virtualization]] in which the guest OS shares the same running instance of the host OS
> - They share the kernel of the OS, although each OS works as if it was running in an isolated environment.
> - this is the tech used by [[Containers]], which would be the equivalent to typical [[Virtual Machines]]
