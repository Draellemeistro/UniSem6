#### Questions and Thoughts
- What advantages do [[Hybrid Architectures]] provide?
- How do publish-subscribe systems handle scalability?
# Distributed vs Decentralized
![[image_System Architectures.png]]
## Two views on Realizing [[Distributed Systems]]
- **integrated view:** Connecting existing networked computer systems into a larger system.
- **Expansive view:** An existing networked computer system is extend with additional computers
### Two definitions
> [!NOTE] **1:** A decentralized system is a networked computer system in which processes and resources are necessarily spread across multiple computers.

> [!NOTE] **2:** A distributed system is a networked computer system in which processes and resources are sufficiently spread across multiple computers.

# System Architectures
**Types of System Architectures**
Client-Server, Peer-to-Peer, [[Hybrid Architectures]](Cloud Computing, Edge Computing, Blockchain Architecture)
- [[System Topologies]]
	- [[client-server]] Architecture
	- [[Peer-to-Peer (P2P)]] Architecture
	- [[Hybrid Architectures]]
	    - [[Cloud Computing]]
	    - [[Edge Computing]]
	    - [[Blockchain Architecture]]
	- [[Layered Architectures]]
	- [[Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)]]
	- [[Event-Driven Architecture]] (Publish-Subscribe)
	- [[RESTful Architectures]]
## [[client-server]] Architecture

## [[Peer-to-Peer (P2P)]] Architecture
**Also known as Symmetrically Distributed Architectures.** Can be:
- Structured
- Unstructured
