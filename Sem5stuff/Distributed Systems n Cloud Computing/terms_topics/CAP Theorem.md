Distributed systems can't avoid the dangers of network failures. Venn diagrams, but they dont all overlap. You can choose 2, so: **CA**, **CP**, or **AP**

> [!NOTE] **CAP** (choose **2** drop **1**)
> - **C**onsistency: *every read receives the most recent write or an error. Note that [[consistency]] as defined in the [[CAP Theorem]] is quite diffrent from the consistenc guaranteed in [[ACID database]] transactions.*
> - **A**vailability: *every reqyest received by a non-failing node in the system must result in response. different from high availability in SW architecture*
> - **P**artition tolerance: *System continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped or delayed by the network between nodes.*
