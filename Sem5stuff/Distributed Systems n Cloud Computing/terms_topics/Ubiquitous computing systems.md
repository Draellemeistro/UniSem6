**Pervasive and CONTINUOUSLY PRESENT**
i.e, there is a continuous interaction between system and user
**EXAMPLE:** A smart car that adapts automatically to different drivers (seat position, favourite radio station, mirrors etc.)
## Core elements
- **Distribution**: devices are networked, distributed and accessible transparently
- **Interactions**: interaction between users and devices is highly unobtrusive 
- **Context awareness**: the system is aware of a userøs context to optimize interaction 
- **Autonomy**: Devices operate autonomy without intervention and this highly self-managed 
- **Intelligence**: The system as a whole can handle a wide range of dynamic actions and interactions
