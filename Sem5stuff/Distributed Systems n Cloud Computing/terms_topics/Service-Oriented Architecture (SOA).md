Components provide services to one another
## Object-based style
Components are objects, connected to each other through procedure calls. objects may be placed on different machines; calls can this execute across a network. (Objects are said to ENCAPSULATE DATA and offer METHODS ON THAT DATA without revealing the internal implementation.)
