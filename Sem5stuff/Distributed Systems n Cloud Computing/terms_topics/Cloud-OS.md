[[Kubernetes]] is known as THE operating system of the cloud; 
### WHY?
it abstracts differences between cloud platforms, similar to how traditional OSs abstract server resources.

**Abstracts away cloud and datacenter complexities, allowing developers to focus on apps without worrying about specific resources** (compute nodes, failure zines, storage volumes). Kubernetes optimally manages resources, **making development and deployment easier.**
#### Key functions
Resource Abstraction. Enabler for Hybrid Cloud, Multi-Cloud, Cloud Migrations

Kubernetes schedules application microservices regardless of the underlying cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
