# General 
## Basics
> [!NOTE] **Comparison:** [[Virtualization]] of [[Virtual Machines|Virtual Machines]] and [[Containers]] (_note the [[Hypervisor]]_)
> ![[image_Virtualization-1.png]]
# [[Kata-Containers]]
> [!NOTE] [[Kata-Containers]] designed to provide stronger isolation than traditional containers while maintaining container-like performance
> Each container runs inside a lightweight  [[Virtual Machines|Virtual Machine]] providing hardware-based isolation.
> **Pros:** security & isolation similar to VMs while preserving container workflows
> **Cons:** slightly more resource overhead, slower startup compared to traditional [[Containers]]


## Containerization
The sprocess of packaging an application and dependencies as an image and then running it as a container.
