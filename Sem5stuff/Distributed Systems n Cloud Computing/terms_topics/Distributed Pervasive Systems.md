##### Observation
Emerging next-gen of distributed systems in which nodes are small,mobile and often embedded in a larger system, characterized by the fact that the system naturally blends into the users environment
#### Three overlapping subtypes
###### [[Ubiquitous computing systems]]:
**Pervasive and CONTINUOUSLY PRESENT**
i.e, there is a continuous interaction between system and user
**EXAMPLE:** A smart car that adapts automatically to different drivers (seat position, favourite radio station, mirrors etc.)
##### [[Mobile computing systems]]:
**Pervasive, but emphasis is on the fact that devices are INHERENTLY MOBILE**

##### [[Sensor (and actuator) networks]]:
**Pervasive, with emphasis on the actual (collaborative) SENSING and ACTUATION of the environment.**
