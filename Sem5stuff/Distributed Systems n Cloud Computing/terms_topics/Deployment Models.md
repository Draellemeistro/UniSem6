# Public Cloud

- Owned and operated by big companies: google, amazon, microsoft...
- serves multiple clients
- same hardware for all clients
- clients pay based on resource-utilization
- Client data is outsourced from the clients company to big data servers.

# Private Cloud

- Owned and operated by the client
- hardware dedicated to the client
 	- (client = company)
- Usually higher costs for allocating space, hardware and management (security, networking etc. ) compared to public cloud (**economics of scale y'know**)
- more control over security and privacy compared to public cloud (if handled correctly ofc)
- **Data under clients control**

# Hybrid Cloud

- Part of data stored and processed on private cloud and part on public cloud
- mroe flexible solution for private and sensitive data
- high flex for computationally incisive ops
- preferred by many companies

# Multi-Cloud (community?)
