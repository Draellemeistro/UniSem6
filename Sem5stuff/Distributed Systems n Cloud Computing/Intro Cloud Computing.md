# Objectives and relation to the semester theme

The course aims to introduce students to the principles of distributed systems and their extensions to cloud computing. Students learn to analyze challenges in the design and implementation of distributed systems. Students are introduced to current technologies for distributed systems as well as computing principles and paradigms, such as microservices and cloud computing.

### The course will establish fundamentals of the distributed systems and cloud computing, covering the following topics:

- Benefits of distributed systems, but also their challenges,
- Several well-known problems tackled by distributed systems, such as coordination and consensus and the various algorithms used to address these issues,
- How cloud computing makes it easy and fast for developers to build distributed systems,
- How [[virtualization]] forms the basis of cloud functionality,
- How cloud computing can be used to process large amounts of data (big data)

In the context of the semester theme, the course covers the distributed system and cloud computing and their integration in the framework of distributed application design and development.

### Scope and expected performance

The course workload is 5 ECTS. It will consist of 10 modules, mainly delivered through lectures followed by exercises. The students will also have the opportunity to work on practical miniprojects, discussed during the semester.  

The modules of the course will be mainly used for presentations and discussion (around 40 hours). The students will have the option of working on three mini projects that should cover around 70 hours. The rest of the hours will be covered by preparation for the exam.

### Mini-projects\
During the course, we will give **two** **non-mandatory assignments**, one in the middle of the course and the other towards the end. The idea of the assignments is that you can try to practice as much as possible during the course, to get feedback, and to use them as a starting point for the examination (see below).

#### Programming language
You are free to use any programming language you want during the course and for the assignments. However, consider that I will be using Python to showcase the theoretical principles and for our solutions to the exercises.  
Nevertheless, you can decide what language to use for doing your exercises or for the examination, as follows:  

- **C** (you had it in the 1st semester) or  
- **Python** (The book uses this for the examples + I guess you have used it for some semester projects - if not, it could be a good idea to start learning it this semester) or 
- **Java** (you had it in the 4th semester + I think is a very good language for Networking and distributed applications).

## Examination
The assessment will involve a 20-minute oral examination. The students will have the option to either showcase one of the mini projects and discuss the project report (NOT mandatory to enter the exam) as well as the topics revolving around the miniproject theme. Alternatively, the students will be asked to discuss a topic from the curriculum selected by the examinators. In both cases, the discussion will be the basis for the final evaluation and grading.
