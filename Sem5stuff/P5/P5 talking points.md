### People are fucking stupid
- **2006** ([link](https://www.darkreading.com/perimeter/social-engineering-the-usb-way)) "*Of the 20 USB drives we planted, 15 were found by employees, and all had been plugged into company computers... after only three days.*"
	- **2011** ([link](https://thenextweb.com/news/us-govt-plant-usb-sticks-in-security-study-60-of-subjects-take-the-bait)) US Govt. plant USB sticks in security study, 60% of subjects take the bait. this number increased to 90% when drivers were branded with a government logo
- **2011** ([link](https://www.pcworld.com/article/481721/companies_lose_2_5_million_from_missing_memory_sticks_study_says.html)) companies have lost more than $2.5 million per company because of misplaced USB drives
- **2011** ([link](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/secret-defence-documents-lost-to-foreign-intelligence-278961)) an Australian defense aide lost top secret documents stored on a USB drive in transit through Kuwait

## Implementation possibilities
- **fuzzing**
	- **[102](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-14/materials/eu-14-Schumilo-Dont-Trust-Your-USB-How-To-Find-Bugs-In-USB-Device-Drivers-wp.pdf)** QEMU-based, parallizable virtual USB fuzzer (vUSBf) that makes use of USB redirection to inject arbitrary noise into different GetDescriptor requests ([ELI5 link](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-14/materials/eu-14-Schumilo-Dont-Trust-Your-USB-How-To-Find-Bugs-In-USB-Device-Drivers.pdf))
	- [Syzkaller](https://github.com/google/syzkaller): a coverage-guided syscall fuzzer that has found bugs in the USB subsystem
	- While fuzzing can improve the code quality and raise the bar for attackers, it cannot defend against attacks abusing the USB protocol itself, such as BadUSB attacks.
- packet firewall
	- USBFirewall: focuses on protecting the host USB stack by detecting malformed USB packets, e.g., generated by FaceDancer, based on a formal model of the protocol syntax.
	- USBFILTER/usbtables: a netfilter/iptables-like stack for filtering USB traffic
- Host emu honeypots
	- GoodUSB: To examine a suspicious device, redirects it to a QEMU-KVM virtual machine using USB pass-through.
	-  Cinch system: everages virtualization to decrease the host's attack surface.
		- Within the sacrificial VM, a variety of the application and transport layer defense techniques can be deployed including signature-based antivirus, protocol compliance, and user-driven access control.
