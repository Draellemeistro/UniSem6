To prevent compromise within your Kubernetes cluster during file transfer and analysis, apply these Kubernetes security best practices:
**Convert File Formats:** Convert files to safer formats (e.g., convert Word to PDF) as a precaution to strip out malicious macros or scripts.
- **Pod Security Policies**: Use Pod Security Policies (PSP) to ensure containers run with minimal privileges and prevent unwanted access.
- **Namespace Isolation**: Consider isolating your file-processing containers in separate Kubernetes namespaces. This will limit access to other critical resources.
- **Network Policies**: Implement **network policies** to control which services can communicate with each other inside the Kubernetes cluster, especially limiting access between nodes and potentially malicious file-processing pods.
- **Limit Container Privileges**: Use **Kubernetes Security Contexts** to ensure containers run with restricted privileges (e.g., not as root).

## Functional Requirements
### USB Device Detection
+ The system must automatically detect when a USB device is inserted into the Hardwall
+ The system must retrieve and send the USB device's characteristics (mere eller mindre prÃ¦cision?) to the backend for analysis.
### Device Content Analysis
- For storage devices, the system must upload the device's content to the cloud backend for malware analysis.
-  The cloud backend must use an isolated (containerized) application to analyze the uploaded content and return an evaluation.
### User Interaction
- The system must display device characteristics **and analyze their resuylts to the user**
- The user must be able to provide instructions on whether or not to allow/block the device based on the analysis results.
### Device Management
- Devices deemed "unsafe" must be blocked from communicating with the connected PC.
### Anomaly Monitoring
- The system must continuously monitor device behavior during the connection.
- If abnormal behavior is detected, the system must terminate the device's connection and notify the user.
- **Administrators must be able to update or deploy new AI models for malware analysis.**
- **Administrators must be able to update or deploy new AI models for keystroke analysis.**

1. **Performance**
    
    - The system must process and display device characteristics within 2 seconds of USB insertion.
    - Malware analysis results must be returned to the user within 10 seconds for devices with less than 100MB of content.
2. **Scalability**
    
    - The backend must scale dynamically using Kubernetes to handle multiple simultaneous device uploads and analysis tasks.
3. **Reliability**
    
    - The system must ensure a 99.9% uptime for device analysis services.
    - The system must handle up to 1,000 concurrent USB device analysis requests without degradation.
4. **Compatibility**
    
    - The system must support a wide range of USB devices, including storage devices, keyboards, and mice.

### **Security Requirements**

1. **Data Protection**
    
    - Device content must be encrypted when transmitted to the cloud backend and stored temporarily in the cloud.
    - Analysis results must only be accessible to the user or administrator who initiated the request.
2. **Access Control**
    
    - Only authorized users and administrators must have access to device instructions or system logs.
    - The system must enforce strict authentication for administrators managing AI models or system performance.
3. **Threat Detection**
    
    - The system must identify and flag devices exhibiting malicious behavior during connection.
    - Logs must be generated and stored for all device interactions and analysis processes for audit purposes.
4. **Fail-Safe Mechanism**
    
    - If the backend or analysis service becomes unavailable, all devices must be blocked by default to prevent security risks.

# Extra Shiiieeet
### **USB Device Detection**

- **Clarification on Device Characteristics**:  
    Specify the level of detail required for the "device characteristics." For example:
    - Vendor ID (VID)
    - Product ID (PID)
    - Serial number
    - Device type (e.g., storage, HID)  
        This will help ensure the backend has sufficient data for analysis.
- **Fallback Detection**:  
    Define a fallback mechanism in case the device characteristics cannot be retrieved due to driver issues or unsupported devices.

---

### **Device Content Analysis**

- **Partial Content Analysis**:  
    For large storage devices, allow the system to analyze a subset of the device (e.g., the most recently modified files or specific directories) to optimize performance and minimize upload time.
- **Classification Scope**:  
    Specify whether the classification will only detect malware or include other indicators such as suspicious file types, corrupted files, or potentially harmful scripts.

---

### **User Interaction**

- **Display Format for Results**:  
    Define how the results are presented to the user (e.g., risk score, threat categories, or detailed breakdown of the findings). This will ensure the results are actionable and easy to interpret.
- **Default Handling Rules**:  
    Include an option for pre-configured default actions (e.g., block all suspicious devices unless manually allowed) to streamline user interaction in high-volume scenarios.

---

### **Device Management**

- **Granular Blocking Rules**:  
    Allow the system to implement fine-grained blocking rules, such as blocking specific file types (e.g., `.exe` or `.vbs`) from being executed or copied from a storage device.

---

### **Anomaly Monitoring**

- **Behavioral Thresholds**:  
    Define thresholds for "abnormal behavior." For example:
    - Excessive keystroke injection rates for HID devices.
    - Unusual power draw or rapid reconnection attempts for other USB devices.
- **Live Monitoring Feedback**:  
    Provide the user with real-time feedback or alerts during monitoring (e.g., "Device attempting unauthorized file transfers").

---

### **Performance**

- **Performance Tiers**:  
    Add scalability for performance targets based on device content size (e.g., for devices with >1GB content, allow longer analysis times with user notification).

---

### **Scalability**

- **Maximum Scalability**:  
    Define an upper scalability limit (e.g., handling a surge of 10,000 concurrent device uploads during peak traffic). This can guide infrastructure provisioning and stress testing.
- **Auto-scaling Triggers**:  
    Specify triggers for backend scaling (e.g., based on CPU/memory usage or queue length for analysis tasks).

---

### **Reliability**

- **Redundancy for Uptime**:  
    Mention strategies to achieve 99.9% uptime, such as load balancing, multi-region deployments, or automatic failover mechanisms.

---

### **Compatibility**

- **Expand USB Class Support**:  
    Consider explicitly including additional USB device classes such as smart card readers or audio devices that could pose risks.
- **Testing Matrix**:  
    Define a testing matrix for compatibility (e.g., support for devices compliant with USB 2.0, 3.0, and newer standards).

---

### **Security Requirements**

#### **Data Protection**

- **Data Retention Policy**:  
    Define a retention policy for device content in the cloud (e.g., "uploaded content must be deleted after 24 hours of analysis unless flagged as malicious").
- **Zero-Knowledge Encryption**:  
    Ensure that the cloud backend implements zero-knowledge encryption, where only the user/admin can decrypt the analysis results.

#### **Access Control**

- **Granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:  
    Add RBAC to enforce differentiated permissions for regular users, administrators, and developers managing AI models.
- **Audit Logging**:  
    Include an explicit requirement for generating audit logs for access to sensitive data (e.g., uploaded files or analysis results).

#### **Threat Detection**

- **Behavioral Analysis Models**:  
    Specify if the threat detection system should include behavioral analysis for HID devices (e.g., identifying suspicious keystroke patterns or macros).
- **Integration with Threat Feeds**:  
    Allow the backend to integrate with external threat intelligence feeds (e.g., VirusTotal or commercial threat detection APIs) to enhance detection accuracy.

#### **Fail-Safe Mechanism**

- **Graceful Degradation**:  
    Rather than blocking all devices by default, provide an option for basic static analysis or minimal risk assessments when the backend is offline.
- **Offline Mode**:  
    Allow administrators to configure rules for handling devices in offline mode (e.g., block storage devices but allow basic HID devices like keyboards).

---

### **Additional Considerations**

- **Regulatory Compliance**:  
    If the system handles sensitive or personal data, ensure compliance with relevant regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, or HIPAA.
- **Test Coverage**:  
    Include requirements for test coverage, such as "the system must pass security tests for all supported device classes using industry-standard penetration testing tools."
- **User Training**:  
    Provide user training or documentation to help users interpret analysis results and make informed decisions.
