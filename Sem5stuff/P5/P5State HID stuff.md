## [Keystroke dynamics as a biometric for authentication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X9900059X)
We argue that the use of keystroke rhythm is a natural choice for computer security. This argument stems from observations that similar neuro-physiological factors that make written signatures unique, are also exhibited in a userâ€™s typing pattern ==14==

When a person types, the latencies between successive keystrokes, keystroke durations, finger placement and applied pressure on the keys can be used to construct a unique signature (i.e., profile) for that individual.

his paper presents our results for an authentication system based on the use of keystroke dynamics. Keystroke dynamics is the process of analyzing the way a user types at a terminal by monitoring the keyboard inputs thousands of times per second, and attempts to identify them based on habitual rhythm patterns in the way they type. We present our data selection and extraction methods as well as our classification and identification strategies. Our observations and findings are discussed and compared with prior work in this area.
