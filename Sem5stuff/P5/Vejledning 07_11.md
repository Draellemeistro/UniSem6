- Hvad med IoT miniprojekt?
	- Kan vi snuppe Jespers ide

- We're considering collecting data to train an algorithm on HID keyboard / mouse activity, but we're not quite sure if that is time well spent. Do you have a general idea/guesstimate on the rough amount or effort needed to collect this?
- If we decided to use the machine learning mini-project together with the main semester project, would that work then only be relevant in the mini-project, and discounted in the main one?
- Who is the lab assistent that can help us get ahold of components? We haven't been able to find an e-mail.
- Presuming we have a dataset consisting of different types of malware. Then train a model to classify the different types of malware in the dataset. Would you be able to use this model to determine if a sample is benignware using the outputted certainty? Eg. if the certainty is very low on all types of malware labels it must be benign?
-  We have been trying to draw up some diagrams for the system, but have already become unsure of some things. In a basic context diagram, we're uncertain if the functionality in the cloud should be separate from the system or not?

We have also been looking into doing a mini project for the iot course and we found a project at Jespers workplace, which could be interesting. He works in a science center, that teaches kids about sustainability. For one of the courses about electricity, they would like optimize one of the assignments, an escape room to be more automated. There is alot of different items we can use, such as 20 philip hue lightbues, 20 different aqara wireless mini switches and a zigbee dongle (and maybe other stuff aswell) Could a project be to connect these together, make a nice frontend with battery status, offline/online mode and different color modess?
