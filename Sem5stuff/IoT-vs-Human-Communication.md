> [!NOTE] What is different in [[IoT]] (see: [[Internet of Things]])
> - **invisibility** (absence of human control and intervention)
> - **Criticality** (we start to rely on wireless comms in various life-saving and safety critical applications, such as **eHealth** and **Smart Grid**)
> - **Intrusiveness** (if privacy and security not properly addressed, instead of "_better managed_" systems, we get a nightmare)

### Role and capabilities of the end device are varying
- Complex machines, e.g., planes or cars
- Everyday applicances (consumer refrigerators)
- very simple devices ( [[IoT-Sensors|sensors]] like humidity sensors etc)
### Variety of service requirements
- Traffic burstiness / regularity
	- Smart meter vs event-driven surveillance camera
- Data chunk size
	- Single sensor reading vs image
- Dependability requirements
	- emergency data vs regular update
### Massiveness
-  enormous number of connected devices


### Most [[IoT device|IoT devices]] have very different features compared to the usual wireless devices
- **limited functionality:** 
	- Limited processing power, lack of software updates
	- Driven by the target to achieve extremely low cost
- **Stringent requirements on energy consumption**
	- Battery may not be rechargeable, while operational time should be more than 10 yrs (example)
- **Embedded devices**
	- Often inaccessible and irreparable, such as in buildings or cars
	- Should be deployed by projecting long-term future use
