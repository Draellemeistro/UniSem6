- **limited functionality:** 
	- Limited processing power, lack of software updates
	- Driven by the target to achieve extremely low cost
- **Stringent requirements on [[Duty cycle and Battery energy|energy consumption]] (see [[IoT device-Power Consumption]] also)**
	- Battery may not be rechargeable, while operational time should be more than 10 yrs (example)
- **Embedded devices**
	- Often inaccessible and irreparable, such as in buildings or cars
	- Should be deployed by projecting long-term future use
