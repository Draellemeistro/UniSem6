[[IoT-Edge-Cloud]]
[[Cloud IoT]]

In this lecture, we focus on the integration of IoT devices within the major cloud providers([[Cloud IoT]]), namely [[Google Cloud IoT|Google Cloud]], [[Microsoft Azure IoT|Microsoft Azure]], and [[AWS IoT|AWS]].

We define what are the components of an [[IoT-Edge-Cloud]] and how they connect with each other.

We discuss about [[device provisioning]] and how it can be utilized to onboard new devices into the system.  

We then explore some of the different [[IoT-Cloud Services]] that can be utilized to process and analyze the IoT data.
