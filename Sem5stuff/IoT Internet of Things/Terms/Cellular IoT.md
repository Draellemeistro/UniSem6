[[LTE-M]], [[NB-IoT]], [[RedCap]]
**A cellular network, where the [[IoT device]]s have a cellular radio interface**

- "_legacy_" standards:
	- [[2G]]: GSM/GPRS/EGPRS â€“ considerable usage in IoT solutions
	- [[3G]] - **not really**
	- [[4G]] - **NOT A VERY GOOD OPTION**
- NEW standards:
	- [[LTE-M]]
	- [[NB-IoT]]
	- [[RedCap|5G RedCap]] (Reduced Capability) - **in very early stages**


## What is [[Cellular IoT]]?
#### Current cellular systems are designed for human-to-human ([[H2H]]):
- We are not too many users, in the end
- We tolerate delay/jitter, even for voice connections
- we like to download a lot, mainly high bandwidth data
- we don't mind to recharge our mobiles on daily basis
- we raise alert when mobile is compromised or stolen
### Accomodating [[IoT]] requires paradigm shift:
- There will be orders of magnitudes more IoT nodes than humans
- More and more applications are delay-intolerant, mainly control
- There will be a little traffic per node, and mainly in the uplink
	- Integration of distributed ledger technologies challenges this assumption
- Nodes need to run autonomously for a long time
- automated security & trust mechanisms
