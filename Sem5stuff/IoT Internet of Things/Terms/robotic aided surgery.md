**Involves human in the loop**
Surgeons are remotely using instruments that feature much better precision and finer movements than humans

##### Use case 1
Periodic communication for the support of precise cooperative robotic motion control and haptic feedback in case of robotic aided surgery where the surgeon console and the robot are collocated in the same operating room (non-public network).
##### Use case 2
 Periodic communication for the support of cooperative robotic motion control and haptic feedback in case of telesurgery. In this case, the surgeon console and the robot are not collocated and communicate with each other through a connection established over a PLMN possibly spanning an entire country.
