### used alot in [[IIoT]] ([[Industrial IoT]])
- Deterministic sensing-control-actuation cycles
- Easy to deal with in terms of scheduling
	- Static scheduling
- Isochronous communications
	- All devices have to be tightly synchronized
		- i.e., should have the same absolute time references
- Extreme reliability-latency requirements
	- Short cycle times - 1 ms
		- communication latency 0.1 ms
		- reliability $1-10^{-6}$
