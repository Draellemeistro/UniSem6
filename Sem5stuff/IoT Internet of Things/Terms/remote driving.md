**A combination of [[eMBB]] and [[URLLC]]**
- a Vehicle is controlled remotedly by either a human operator or cloud computing
	- requires the cellular network coverage (road-side units)
- **requirements:**
	- UL and DL reliability of 99.999% or higher for UE supporting safety-related V2X application for an absolute speed of up to 250 km/h
	- End-to-end latency 5 ms between V2X application server and UE supporting safety-related V2X application for an absolute speed of up to 250 km/h
		- U-plane radio latency can be estimated as 1/10 of the [[E2E]] latency
	- User experienced data rate up to 1 Mbps at DL and 25 Mbps at UL for UE supporting V2X application for an absolute speed of up to 250 km/h
		- The assumption is that H.265/HEVC HD stream is up to 10 mb/s and two video streams are delivered to a remote driver
