ML Inference at the [[Edge ML-AI]] with/without [[TPU]]
- Time spent to perform a single inference with several popular models on the Edge TPU
	- For the sake of comparison, all models running on both CPU and Edge [[TPU]] are the  [[TensorFlow]] Lite versions.
- They are all trained using the **ImageNet dataset** with 1.000 classes.

## [[Azure IoT-Edge]]
Allows you to deploy complex event processing, machine learning, image recognition, and other high value AI without writing it in-house.
- Azure services like Azure Functions, Azure Stream Analytics, and Azure Machine Learning can all be run on-premises via Azure IoT Edge
- Youâ€™re not limited to Azure services, though. Anyone is able to create AI modules and make them available to the community for use through the Azure Marketplace
