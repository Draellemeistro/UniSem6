Industrial applications are typically divided into:
- **[[Process Automation (PA) (batch processing)]]**
	- Monitoring and control of continuous flow (process)
	- **Examples:** chemical manufacturing, pulp & paper, oil & gas, etc....
- **[[Factory automation (FA) (discrete automation)]]**
	- Perform discrete control over subtasks
	- **Examples:** Electronics, cars

## [[Industrial Communication]]
- **Communication/networking** is the backbone of all industrial automation components for efficient production systems
- Communication between devices and controllers were originally based on **wired connections**
- First generation of industrial communication networks were built on a variety of serial-based protocols
