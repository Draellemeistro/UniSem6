> [!NOTE] **[[Channel hopping]]:** changing transmission frequency per user
> - Provide more reliable communication
> - Reduce probability of interference (within the [[ISM bands|ISM band]])
> - Provide degree of robustness to channel fading
> 
> Switching occurs based on a pseudo-random sequence (hopping sequence) known to the transmitter and the receiver
