## [[5G]] Networks: Threat vectors
![[image_5G-4.png]]
### [[5G]] networks are exposed to Cyber attacks
- **Increased attack surface:** 5G networks allow for **a massive increase in connected devices** (up to 1 million per km) and data traffic. This expanded attack presents more opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access to the network.
- **IoT integration:** Attackers can now target connected devices, smart grids, and industrial control systems, potentially causing widespread disruptions and even physical harm
- **Distributed edge computing:** 5G enables edge computing, bringing computing resources closer to end users and devices. Edge devices may be more **vulnerable** to attacks due to their **distributed nature and limited resources**
- **Supply Chain Risks:** The global nature of 5G network equipment manufacturing and deployment introduces supply chain vulnerabilities. Malicious actors could **infiltrate** the supply chain and tamper with hardware or software components, **potentially compromising the security of the entire network.**
- **Cloud-Native security:** 5G networks leverage cloud-native technologies, making them more scalable and flexible. However, securing cloud-native environments introduces challenges, such as **container security, orchestration security, and ensuring the integrity of software supply.**
- **Virtualization and software-defined networking (SDN):** 5G networks rely heavily on virtualization and SDN, which can become **security weaknesses if the system is not adequately secured**
- **Network slicing: Slicing adds complexity** to the network and creates potential security vulnerabilities. If slicing is poorly managed, **unauthorized parties can access data** in different network slices, **deny access** to users, or even **disrupt critical services**
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Security:** The use of AI in 5G networks for tasks, such as **network optimization** and **anomaly detection** introduces the risk of AI-powered attacks. Adversaries could exploit AI algorithms to launch targeted attacks or manipulate AI-driven decision-making processes.
