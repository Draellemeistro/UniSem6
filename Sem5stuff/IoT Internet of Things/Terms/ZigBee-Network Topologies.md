[[Zigbee]] supports **star**, tree, **and** **mesh** topologies
- [[Star Topology]]: is efficient for low delay and small networks
- [[Tree Topology]]:  is preferred in large scale networks
- [[Mesh Topology]]: Provides more reliable communication (**Redundant paths**)

## [[Network Topologies]]
> [!NOTE] Based on [[IEEE 802.15.4]]s (network) [[IEEE 802.15.4-Network Topologies|IEEE Topologies]]
> - [[Mesh Topology]] (based on [[Peer-to-Peer Topology]] of [[IEEE 802.15.4]])
> - [[Tree Topology]] (based on [[Star Topology]] of [[IEEE 802.15.4]])
