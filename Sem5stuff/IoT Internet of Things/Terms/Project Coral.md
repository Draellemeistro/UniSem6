###### **AI at the edge** 
(from [[Google Cloud IoT]]) --- [Coral website](https://coral.ai/)
- The Edge TPU allows you to deploy high-quality ML inferencing at the edge, using various prototyping and production products from [Coral](https://coral.ai/).
- Edge [[TPU]] complements CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and other ASIC solutions  for running AI at the edge.
- The Coral platform for ML at the edge augments Google's Cloud TPU and [[Google Cloud IoT]] to provide an end-to-end (cloud-to-edge, hardware + software) infrastructure to facilitate the deployment of customers' AI-based solutions.
- The Coral platform provides a complete developer toolkit so you can compile your own models or retrain several Google AI models for the Edge TPU, combining Google's expertise in both AI and hardware
