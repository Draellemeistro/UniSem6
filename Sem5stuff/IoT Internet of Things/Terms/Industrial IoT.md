# [[IIoT and IoT]]
- IoT is mainly applied to consumer applications (**ex:** home automation, wearables)
- **[[Industrial IoT]] (IIoT)** Is the application of IoT within the industrial sector
- Data collection, connectivity and security are common features of IoT and IIoT

**IIoT brings in the concept of a ´´connected factory´´ leads to a smart factory**
- Remotely monitoring of machines and the industrial process
- Predictive and proactive maintenance
- Safety
- Better analytics to optimize production
- Improved business

## [[IIoT Applications]]
Industrial applications are typically divided into:
- **Process Automation (PA) (batch processing)**
	- Monitoring and control of continuous flow (process)
	- **Examples:** chemical manufacturing, pulp & paper, oil & gas, etc....
- **Factory automation (FA) (discrete automation)**
	- Perform discrete control over subtasks
	- **Examples:** Electronics, cars
