## [[IEEE 802.15.4]] Frequency bands
- Transmissions in [[IEEE 802.15.4]] are performed in [[ISM bands]] (Industrial, Scientific, Medical) bands
	- Open to use (limitations in terms of radiated power)
	- A lot of devices are using [[ISM bands]]
		- i.e., **a lot of interference**
#### IEEE 802.15.4 (original standards) uses bands in:
![[image_Frequency bands-1.png]]
- 868/915 MHz
- 2.4 GHz
> [!NOTE] **In general:** lower frequency $\to$ larger distances + lower data-rates
