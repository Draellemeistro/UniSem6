## Service requirements for cyber-physical control applications in vertical domains (TS 22.104)
#### Examples of use-cases:
###### [[Factories of the Future (Industry 4.0)]]
- [[Motion control]]
- factory automation
- [[Process Automation (PA) (batch processing)]]
- automated guided vehicles
- ....
###### [[Smart grid control and monitoring]]
- primary frequency control
- distributed voltage control
- load controll
- ....
###### [[Connected hospitals]]
- [[robotic aided surgery]]

## Enhancement of 3GPP support for V2X scenarios (TS 22.186)
**V2X is a major driver in [[3GPP standards|3GPP standardization]], starting from Rel-14 ([[4G]])**
- "_90% of new cars will have cellular modems by 2025_"
- "_Several OEMs are already equipping 100% of their vehicles_"
- **TR 38.913:** _“NR V2X shall complement LTE V2X for advanced V2X services and support interworking with LTE V2X_”

#### Two major categories:
- Non-safety (comfort) services
	- Connected vehicle, mobile entertainment, mobile office
- Safety-related services
	- autonomous driving, car platooning
#### Only a handful of [[5G]] uses cases
- vehicle platooning
- [[remote driving]]
- advanced driving
	- semi-automated or fully automated
- extended sensors
	- [[collective perception of environment]]
#### Common characteristics
- data integrity, mutual authentication and confidentiality should be observerd
- carrier frequency below 6 GHz (5.9 GHz)
- can feature road-side units
