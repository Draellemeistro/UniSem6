- In 2018, a large-scale botnet attack was carried out on IoT devices that used the Constrained Application Protocol ([[CoAP]]) for communication
- This attack targeted devices that had CoAP implemented in an unsecured manner, allowing them to be easily compromised and turned into bots
- The attack involved sending a large number of malicious CoAP packets to vulnerable devices, overwhelming them and causing them to crash or become unresponsive
- These devices were then added to the botnet, which could be used for a variety of malicious purposes, such as carrying out DDoS attacks or stealing sensitive data
