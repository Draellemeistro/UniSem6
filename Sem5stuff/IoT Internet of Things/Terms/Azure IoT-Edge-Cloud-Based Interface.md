> [!NOTE] Enables you to remotely monitor and manage IoT Edge devices.

- It is difficult to manage the software life cycle for millions of IoT devices that are often different makes and models or geographically scattered.
- Workloads are created and configured for a particular type of device, deployed to all of your devices, and monitored to catch any misbehaving devices.
- These activities canâ€™t be done on a per device basis and must be done at scale.
- Cloud Services allow to:
	- Create and configure a workload to be run on a specific type of device
	- Send a workload to a set of devices
	- Monitor workloads running on devices in the field
