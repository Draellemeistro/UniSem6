- Runs on each [[Azure IoT-Edge|IoT Edge]] device and manages the modules deployed to each device.

### What it do?
The Azure IoT Edge runtime enables custom and cloud logic on IoT Edge devices. The runtime **sits on the IoT Edge device and performs management and communication operations.**
#### The runtime performs several functions:
- Installs and updates workloads on the device.
- Maintains [[Azure IoT-Edge]] Security standards on the device
- Ensures that [[Azure IoT-Edge-Modules|IoT Edge Modules]] are always running.
- Reports module health to cloud for remote monitoring
- Manages communication between downstream leaf devices and an IoT Edge device, between modules on an IoT Edge device, and between an IoT Edge device and the cloud.
