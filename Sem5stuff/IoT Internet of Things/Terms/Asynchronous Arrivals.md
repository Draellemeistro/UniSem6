- Aka **uncorrelated traffic generations**
- Models periodic reporting
- no synchronism between the reporting devices
- aggregated over devices shows stable (stationary behavior)
	- **Makes it easier to dimension the network**
- Deterministic periodic arrivals
	- [[Real-time control]]
- Uniform, Bernoulli, Poisson arrivals
