> [!NOTE] Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL)

- Low Power and Lossy Networks ([[LLNs]]): Networks formed by devices with constrained capabilities in terms of computation, memory and power
- [[RPL]] : Tree-based network topology, Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph ([[DODAG]])
- The [[DODAG]] is constructed via the exchange of [[RPL]] control messages
- Information Object (**DIO**): construct upward links, i.e., selecting parents (based on hop-count, energy, delay, â€¦
- Destination Advertisement (**DAO**): construct downward links, i.e., routing tables
