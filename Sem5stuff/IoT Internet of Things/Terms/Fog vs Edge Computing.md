there are differences between **Fog Computing** and **Edge Computing**, although they are closely related and often used interchangeably in the context of IoT. Both aim to process data closer to the source to reduce latency, but they differ in architecture and scope. Here's a comparison:

### **1. Definition**

- **[[Fog computing]]**: Extends cloud computing closer to the edge of the network by introducing an intermediate layer (the "fog") between cloud data centers and edge devices. It involves processing data across a distributed network of devices, such as gateways, routers, or even servers located closer to the IoT devices.
- **[[Edge Computing]]**: Focuses on processing data directly on IoT devices or nearby edge devices (e.g., gateways or local servers) without requiring an intermediary layer like fog nodes.
