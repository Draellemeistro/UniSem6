#### (Distributed event-based systems)
disseminating events to multiple recipients with the sender unaware of the identity of the recipients. Typically, senders and receivers communicate through an intermediary (i.e., [[broker]])

### Idea
A large number of **publishers** (producers) **PUBLISH** structured events to an **event service** and a large number of **subscribers** (consumers) **EXPRESS INTEREST** in particular events through subscriptions which can be arbitrary patterns over the structured events.
