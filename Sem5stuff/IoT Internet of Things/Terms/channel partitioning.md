> [!danger] Channel partitioning is about how to separate resources and enable concurrent transmissions

### Several approaches to [[channel partitioning]]
- [[Frequency-division multiplexing]] (FDM)
- [[Time-division multiplexing]] (TDM)
- [[Code-division multiplex]] (CDM)
- combinations of the above

#### [[Frequency-division multiplexing]]
- Channel bandwidth is divided in subchannels (separate frequency bands)
	- A device is assigned a part of the bandwidth (subchannel) all the time
#### [[Time-division multiplexing]]
- Channel time gets divided into periodically recurring time slots
	- A device is assigned all the bandwidth for part of the time (time slot)
#### [[Code-division multiplex]]
- A device is assigned a special code enabling it to use all the bandwidth all the time
##### [[Code-division multiplex|CDM]]: two senders

### combinations of the above
