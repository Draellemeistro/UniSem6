is remotely and aims to infect the device with malware
- **the most common type of adversary**
- Adversary is located remotely
- Tries to gain remote access to the device
### Common attacks to performed by a remote software adversary
##### Brute Force Attack
Try to guess login credentials for listening services, often use precompiled lists of passwords.
##### Buffer Overflow
Exploit memory overflows to execute arbitrary code on the IoT device or crash the device
##### SQL injection
Inject malicious SQL code into web forms or API requests to gain unauthorized access to the device's database or execute arbitrary commands.
##### Cross-Site Scripting (XXS)
Inject malicious scripts into the IoT device's web interface to steal session cookies or execute malicious code.
##### DoS and DDoS
Food IoT devices with a high volume of traffic or requests, overwhelming the device and causing it to become unresponsive or crash.
##### Firmware Vulnerabilities
Analyze the firmware for known vulnerabilities to exploit to gain access or control.
##### Zero-Day Exploits
Discover and exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities (zero-day vulnerabilities) in the software or firmware of IoT devices.
