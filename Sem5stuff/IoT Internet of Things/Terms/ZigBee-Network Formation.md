At the [[ZigBee]] application level, the devices become connected using the binding procedure
- Binding creates logical connection between two or more endpoints
- [[ZigBee]] protocols(see [[ZigBee-Protocol Stack]]) provide mechanisms to support binding procedure and to maintain binding tables in network nodes
