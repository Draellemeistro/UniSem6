# In regards to [[Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks]]
- [[Tree Topology]]
- [[Star Topology]]
- [[Mesh Topology]]

(also [[Peer-to-Peer Topology]])
## From [[ZigBee]]..... [[ZigBee-Network Topologies]]
![[image_Network Topologies 1.png]]
[[Zigbee]] supports star, tree, and mesh topologies
- [[Star Topology]]: is efficient for low delay and small networks
- [[Tree Topology]]:  is preferred in large scale networks
- [[Mesh Topology]]: Provides more reliable communication (**Redundant paths**)
