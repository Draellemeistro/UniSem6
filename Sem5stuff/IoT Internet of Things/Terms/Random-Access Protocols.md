- ### When a user experiences a packet arrival, it attempts to access the channel
	- The attempts are regulated by a **[[Channel Access Protocol]] (CAP)** 
- ### Two or more devices can try to transmit in the same resource
	- In this case, a collision happens
	- Detecting and recovering from collisions are tasks of the **[[Collision-Return Protocol]] (CRP)**
## Three big families of [[Random-Access Protocols]]
#### [[ALOHA]]
- **[[Slotted ALOHA]]:** Part of connection establishment in 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G.
	- [[LoRa]]
#### [[Carrier-sense Multiple Access]] (CSMA), aka _listen-before-talk_

#### [[Access-Tree Algorithms]]
