5G shows, **_theoretically_**, promising performance in many IIoT use-cases [[Industrial IoT]]. In particular [[URLLC]]
Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (from [[5G]]
> [!NOTE] Promising for cellular-based services, what about industrial automation (MTC)

# [[5G]] for [[Industrial automation]]
### 5G Network Deployments in IIoT:
##### Public Network
- Managed by mobile network operator
- production data leaves the premises
- Large coverage area
- **Suitable for remote maintenance and monitoring**
##### Semi-public network
- managed by mobile network operator
- production data partially leaves the premises
- Large coverage area
- High bandwidth
- **Suitable for remote maintenance and monitoring**
##### Private network
- Managed by the end-user (production facility)
- Optimal data privacy, data stays on premises
- Highest reliability
- Highest real-time behavior
- No interference from other devices/networks


# Examples
### Remote-controlled timber loaders via [[5G]] ([link](https://youtu.be/3XxAQJAOmgI))
- Verification of technical requirements of 5G-enabled remote-controlled timber loaders
- Efficient with some identified challenges (KPIs fulfilled within a limited area, single gNB has limited coverage)
