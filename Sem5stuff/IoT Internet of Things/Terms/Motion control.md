##### Closed-loop control in industrial setups
- A multitude of sensors/actuators controlled by a single controller
	- Actuators are typically machines with moving parts
		- risk to the personnel and the production process
###### Controllers periodically communicate with sensors and actuators:
- Transaction: sensing $\to$ control $\to$ actuation
	- isochronous operation
- exchanged messages are small
	- couple of tens of bytes maximum
