In the IoT world, we can find many protocols such as [[Bluetooth]], [[Zigbee]], [[Wi-Fi]], 2G, 3G, 4G, [[5G]],
[[NFC]], and more.
## We usually classify them according to their bandwidth and range
![[image_IoT connectivity technologies.png]]
- This graphic does not represent the power consumption induced by the protocol.
- [[NFC]] is a really low-power protocol: it even runs without any energy storage
- On the bottom right are the low-bandwidth, long-range protocols that have very low power requirements.
	- [[Sigfox]] and [[LoRaWAN]] are considered extremely long range and extremely low-power protocols.

## What is [[5G]]
- **5G networks** are the **next generation** of **wireless cellular networks**
- **Characterised by:**
	- low latency and high throughput
	- high amounts of data that is transmitted and generated
	- the requirement to support a **heterogenous environment** to allow for the **interoperability** between **various devices, network types and [[QoS levels|Quality of Service Requirements]]**
