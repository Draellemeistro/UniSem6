[[asynchronous communication]]???? [[Asynchronous Arrivals]]
- **there are two basic models:**
	- Asynchronous and synchronous reporting (arrivals)

##### [[Asynchronous Arrivals]]
- Aka **uncorrelated traffic generations** 
- Models periodic reporting
- no synchronism between the reporting devices
- aggregated over devices shows stable (stationary behavior)
	- **Makes it easier to dimension the network**
- Deterministic periodic arrivals
	- [[Real-time control]]
- Uniform, Bernoulli, Poisson arrivals

##### [[Synchronous Arrivals]]
- Usersâ€™ traffic arrivals are independent of each other and independent of their previous traffic arrivals
