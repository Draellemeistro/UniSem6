# (CSMA), aka _listen-before-talk_
> [!NOTE] **The main idea** â€“ listen before talk
- Listening = carrier sensing (sensing if there is a carrier already present in the target channel)
- If the channel is busy, defer from sending
	- **polite conversationalist**
- Collisions still may occur due to finite speed of signal propagation
	- Distance, propagation delay, and activity factor of the devices play a role in determining the collision probability
	- IF a collision occurs, there has to be a mechanism in place to detect this and reattempt
