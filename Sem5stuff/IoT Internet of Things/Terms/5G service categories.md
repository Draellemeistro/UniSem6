### [[mIoT]] and [[URLLC]] are novel service category
- together they form [[5G-IoT service category]]
- from the perspective of cellular acces, IoT is also referred to as [[Machine-Type Communications (MTC)]]

> [!NOTE]  **Up to 5G, the primary driver for evolution of mobile cellular networks were human-oriented services** _Higher data rates!_
###### IoT services pose new challenges to mobile cellular networks
- High number of devices in a cell ([[mIoT]])
- Reliability and latency requirements ([[URLLC]])

### [[eMBB]]
- [[massive MIMO]], [[mmWave]]
- **Work “follows in” the footsteps of the previous generations of mobile cellular standards**
- focus on release 15
### [[mIoT]]
- [[LTE-M]], [[NB-IoT]]
- originally in [[4G]], but are (will be) continuously improved through [[5G]] releases
### [[URLLC]]
- The biggest challenge, a lot of work done in Release 16
- However, also has the highest potential to transform the vertical industries

#### [[3GPP standards|3GPP]] [[5G]] timeline
- 3GPP standardization work is carried within releases
- "_release provides a stable platform for the implementation of features at a given point and the allow for the addition of new functionality in subsequent releases._"
- Releases are happening in stages that are executed in parallel across different releases.
