**[[Shadowing]], Shadow fading:** Slow variations in received power due to obstacles on the propagation path...
#### is a stochastic phenomenon
- it is standardly assumed that path loss die to shadowing has a log-normal distribution
$$f_{P_{s}}(x)=\frac{1}{x\sigma \sqrt{ 2\pi }}e^{- \frac{\log^2(x)}{2\sigma^2}}$$

- **Empirical studies have shown that** $\sigma \in [4,13]\text{ dB}$ in outdoor channel

#### Three basic phenomena related to wireless propagation
- **[[Path loss]]:** Depends on frequency, weather conditions, day/night
- **[[Shadowing]], Shadow fading:** Slow variations in received power due to obstacles on the propagation path
- **[[Fading]]:** Fastter variations in received power (faster than [[Shadowing]])
	- Consequence of multipath (i.e., interference among the multiple components of the wave at the point of reception)
	- time and frequency dependent
