- **Small scale variations in received power caused by multipath**
	- Wave components propagate over multiple different paths
	- ![[image_Fading.png]]
- 
- **A number of models:**
	- [[Fading-model Rayleigh]] -no Line-of-Sight (LOS)
	- [[Fading-model Rice]]-LOS dominates
	- [[Fading-model nakagami m]]

- **[[Fading]]:** Fastter variations in received power (faster than [[Shadowing]])
	- Consequence of multipath (i.e., interference among the multiple components of the wave at the point of reception)
	- time and frequency dependent




#### Three basic phenomena related to [[wireless propagation]]
- **[[Path loss]]:** Depends on frequency, weather conditions, day/night
- **[[Shadowing]], Shadow fading:** Slow variations in received power due to obstacles on the propagation path
- **[[Fading]]:** Fastter variations in received power (faster than [[Shadowing]])
	- Consequence of multipath (i.e., interference among the multiple components of the wave at the point of reception)
	- time and frequency dependent
