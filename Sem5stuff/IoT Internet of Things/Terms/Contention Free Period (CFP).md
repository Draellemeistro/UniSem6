![[image_Contention-Access Period (CAP).png]]
- In this topology, so-called <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">beacon enabled</span> mode of operation is used
- Link time is divided in periods called beacon intervals
	- A beacon interval is divided into active and inactive period
	- communication is performed during the **active period**.
	- an **Active period** is divided into:
		- [[Contention-Access Period (CAP)]] - contention-based, exists always
		- [[Contention Free Period (CFP)]] - optional
