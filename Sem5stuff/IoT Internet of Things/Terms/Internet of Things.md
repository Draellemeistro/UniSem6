oops, double IoTs, one being this ([[Internet of Things]]), the other being [[IoT]]
**The paradigm of autonomous devices that communicate and collaborate over the internet**
- A set of ICTs able to measure, deliver, process, mine data, and react in an autonomous fashion, involving minimal human intervention

###### Examples of IoT services include:
- Micro-climate monitoring of homes
- asset tracking during transportation
- Controlling the power consumption of all the refrigerators in a ountry depending on the load...

**The networking part of IoT system is often referred to as:**
- [[machine-to-machine]] (M2M) communications, or
- [[Machine-Type Communications (MTC)]]
- 
# [[IoT-vs-Human-Communication|Difference in relation to typical human-oriented communication]]
- **Role and capabilities of the end device are varying**
	- **Complex machines**, e.g., planes or cars. **Everyday applicances** (consumer refrigerators). **very simple devices** ( [[IoT-Sensors|sensors]] like humidity sensors etc)
- **Variety of service requirements**
	- **Traffic burstiness / regularity:** Smart meter vs event-driven surveillance camera. 
	  -- **Data chunk size:** Single sensor reading vs image. 
	  -- **Dependability requirements:** emergency data vs regular update
-  **Massiveness**
	- enormous number of connected devices
## What is different in [[IoT]]?
- **invisibility** (absence of human control and intervention)
- **Criticality** (we start to rely on wireless comms in various life-saving and safety critical applications, such as **eHealth** and **Smart Grid**)
- **Intrusiveness** (if privacy and security not properly addressed, instead of "_better managed_" systems, we get a nightmare)
### Most [[IoT device|IoT devices]] have very different features compared to the usual wireless devices [[Devices-IoT-vs-Wireless]]
- **limited functionality:** 
	- Limited processing power, lack of software updates
	- Driven by the target to achieve extremely low cost
- **Stringent requirements on energy consumption**
	- Battery may not be rechargeable, while operational time should be more than 10 yrs (example)
- **Embedded devices**
	- Often inaccessible and irreparable, such as in buildings or cars
	- Should be deployed by projecting long-term future use
