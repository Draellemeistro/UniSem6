## Main characteristics of [[IoT device]]s
- **Hardware Design**
	- low-cost, small, heterogenous
	- Constraint capabilities: limited computational power, limited storage, low energy
- **Data**
	- Sensitive data: location, personal information, health data, video, audio
	- Technical data: environmental data, updated reports
- **Communications**
	- Different protocols: 3G, [[5G]], [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]], [[MQTT]], [[ZigBee]]
	- **low bandwidth**
- **Applications**
	- Open / closed platforms
	- variable policies
	- High data volume handling
### [[IoT device]]s prone to cyber attacks [[IoT Security]]
##### EASY TO EXPLOIT
- Resource-constrained devices with low-cost design
- Do not support complex security techniques
##### ATTRACTIVE TARGET
- Deployed in safe-critical domains
- Contain sensitive data & control physical environment
##### AMPLIFY THE ATTACK IMPACT
- Many interconnected devices
- Spread quickly the malware


#### The IoT trend
- Increasing number of IoT devices
- Increasing data generated by IoT devices

## Challenges in IoT-to-Cloud
- **Network Bandwidth Constraints:** Sending all the data to the cloud will require high network bandwidth. It is often unnecessary or sometimes prohibited due to regulations and data privacy concerns.
- **Resource-Constrained Devices:** IoT devices have limited resources. They cannot interact directly with the cloud because such interactions often require resource-intensive processing and complex protocols
- **Low Latency Requirements:** Many IoT applications often demand that end-to-end latencies between the sensor and the control node stay within a few milliseconds
- **Uninterrupted connectivity to the Cloud:** Cloud services will have difficulty providing uninterrupted services to devices and systems that have intermittent network connectivity to the cloud. (For example: vehicles, drones, etc.)
- **Context awareness:** Some IoT applications require access to local context information
