simple device that has integrated antenna and an IC (chip) containing the operational logic

- [[RFID-tags|tags]] are very simple and cheap devices, whose main purpose is to identify the object to which they are attached to
	- <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">the main idea</span> was to replace the bar-code with a faster (more automatized), non-line of sight system
- The cost of the [[RFID-tags|tag]] should be significantly lower than the cost of object it identifies
	- either very cheap [[RFID-tags|tag]] or a very expensive object

# Types of [[RFID-tags]]
Tags can be **passive, semipassive**(aka battery-assisted)**, Active**

### [[Passive RFID tags]]
- No power source of their own
- The reads powers through its transmission both the IC and the tag transmitter
### [[Semipassive RFID tags]] (_aka battery-assisted_)
- A (small, coin sized) battery is used to power the IC of the tag
- The tag transmitter is powered by the transmission of the reader
### [[Active RFID tags]]
- Battery powers both the IC and the conventional transmitter
