> [!NOTE] Line-of-Sight (LOS) **dominates**
- **Small scale variations in received power caused by multipath**
	- Wave components propagate over multiple different paths
- **A number of models:**
	- [[Fading-model Rayleigh]] -no Line-of-Sight (LOS)
	- [[Fading-model Rice]]-LOS dominates
	- [[Fading-model nakagami m]]
