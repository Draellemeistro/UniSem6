## Explain two reasons why [[5G-Security]] is exposed to cyberattacks.
- **Increased attack surface:** 5G networks allow for **a massive increase in connected devices** (up to 1 million per km) and data traffic. This expanded attack presents more opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access to the network.
- 5G enables edge computing, bringing computing resources closer to end users and devices. Edge devices may be more **vulnerable** to attacks due to their **distributed nature and limited resources**
-  *Supply Chain Risks:** The global nature of 5G network equipment manufacturing and deployment introduces supply chain vulnerabilities. Malicious actors could **infiltrate** the supply chain and tamper with hardware or software components, **potentially compromising the security of the entire network.**
