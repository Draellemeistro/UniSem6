##### The IoT trend
- Increasing number of IoT devices
- Increasing data generated by IoT devices
###### EASY TO EXPLOIT
- Resource-constrained devices with low-cost design
- Do not support complex security techniques
###### ATTRACTIVE TARGET
- Deployed in safe-critical domains
- Contain sensitive data & control physical environment
###### AMPLIFY THE ATTACK IMPACT
- Many interconnected devices
- Spread quickly the malware
### Describe two examples of common attacks in IoT.
### Mention two examples of how [[Fog computing]] can improve [[IoT Security]].
[[Fog-Security]] 
###### [[Fog-Security-Solutions]]
Fog computing enhances security by providing **real-time, localized,** and **resilient processing capabilities** at the network's edge.
**AS A RESULT, FOG COMPUTING CONTRIBUTES TO:**
- More effective threat detection
- Quicker response times
- Improved protection of sensitive data

###### <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">BUT.... also some not so good stuff</span> 
The fog allows applications to process user’s data in third-party’ s hardware/software. This introduces strong **concerns about data privacy** and its visibility to those third-parties

In such a setting, it is challenging to manage secure **access control, determine the trustworthiness of devices**, manage the security of edge devices **throughout their entire lifecycle**, including updates and patch management, etc.
