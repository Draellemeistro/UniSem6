# Question 1
## Differences between typical IoT anmd Standard Wireless Devices
Typically, IoT devices differ from standard wireless devices in following ways:

##### Limited Functionality:
- Limited processing power, lack of software updates
- Driven by the target to achieve extremely low cost
##### Stringent Requirements on Energy Consumption
- Battery may not be rechargeable, while operational time should be more than 10 yrs (example)
##### Embedded Devices
- Often inaccessible and irreparable, such as in buildings or cars
- Should be deployed by projecting long-term future use.
###### **ALSO:** Power Consumption, Connectivity, Processing Power and Communication Patterns
- IoT devices are optimized for low power consumption,
  - whereas standard wireless devices (smartphones etc.) prioritize performance.
- IoT often use LPWAN (like LoRa, NB-IoT) or short-range protocols (ZigBee, Bluetooth, BLE).
  - Standard wireless devices rely more on high speed Wi-Fi or cellular networks.
- Limited computational capabilities as they are designed to perform specific tasks efficiently
- Often set to sleep, i.e., they only operate in intervals, periodically sending small(?) amounts of data.
  - Standard wireless devices generally support and are used for continuous streaming of data (YouTube, Scrolling TikTok etc.)

## What are the basic tasks that a typical IoT device performs and what are their relative power consumptions?
### Sensing, Processing(?), Actuation, Communication
- **Sensing:** Collect data from env using sensors
  - Low Power
- **Processing:** Perform local compute or preprocessing
  - Low(?)/Medium Power
- **Communication:** Transmit data to the cloud / other devices
  - High Power
- **Actuation:** Take action based on received data.
  - Medium / High Power
##### Sensing, Computing, Communication.
Sensing and computing generally don't get any where near as hungry as Communication.
Communication is the real 'killer' when it comes to power consumption and battery life in IoT devices.
## What is the basic strategy to reduce energy consumption of a typical IoT device?
### Sleep... Make em sleep to save power.
Lower the amount of communication needed,
make the device sleep between transmissions (wake it when scheduled communication approaches)

# Question 2

# Question 3
## What are general characteristics of IoT traffic with respect to the standard types of IoT applications?
### Event-driven and Periodic traffic
- **Event-driven:** Devices send data only when event (a trigger of sorts) happens.
- **Periodic:** Devices send data at regular intervals (think of a monitor or heartbeat sensor)
#### Also, maybe... ?
- **Bulk Data Traffic:** Think Video Surveillance
- **Latency-Sensitive Traffic:** Real-time critical applications (some forms of industrial automation)
## Elaborate the differences between asynchronous and synchronous traffic generation
Maybe see asynchronous arrivals and real-time control ???
### synchronous traffic
Data is transmitted at regular time intervals (e.g., sensor networks with periodic updates).
### asynchronous traffic
Data is transmitted at regular time intervals (e.g., sensor networks with periodic updates).
# Question 4
## Exlpain the differences between the reservation (grant) based access and the reservation-free access
### Grant/Reservation-based
- Devices must request access from the network before transmitting data.
  - LTE, 5G scheduling
### Grant/Reservation-free
- Devices can transmit data without prior request
  - LoRa, ALOHA-based systems

- RFD is pretty much just a basic end device with limited Functionality.
## What kind of network topologies are supported?
**There can be two types of topologies in [[IEEE 802.15.4]]:**
### [[Star Topology]]
- [[Full Function Device (FFD)|FFD]] can communicate with [[Full Function Device (FFD)|FFD]] and [[Reduced Function Device (RFD)|RFD]]
- [[Reduced Function Device (RFD)|RDF]] can communicate only with [[Full Function Device (FFD)|FFD]]
### [[Peer-to-Peer Topology]]
- [[Reduced Function Device (RFD)|RFD]] Can communicate with other [[Reduced Function Device (RFD)|RFDs]] (if they are in reach of each other)
- Coordinator still has to exist ([[Full Function Device (FFD)|FFD]]s can only be this)

# Question 7

  - Subscriber: receive messages from broker
    - Publishers DO NOT NEED TO KNOW the number or identity of subscribers
    - and subscribers DO NOT NEED TO KNOW the number or identity of publishers
### Runs over TCP, and implements 'topics' (categories) and wildcards
## Explain the broker and topic Concepts
- Broker is just a central element that manages message delivery
- Topics can be visualized as a file tree (branching, and with possible sub trees)
